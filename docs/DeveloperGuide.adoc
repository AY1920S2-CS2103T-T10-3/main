== Introduction
This section will introduce the intended use of the document and how to navigate it.
[[Introduction-Purpose]]
=== Purpose
The purpose of this document is to give insight to the implementation of the app, $AVE IT. This
will give developers a better understanding on how they can work on the app in the future.

[[Introduction-Usage]]
=== Usage
==== Navigate
Navigate the document by using `control - f` for Windows User or
`command - f` for Mac Users. Alternatively, there is a clickable content page
at the start of the document which you can click and bring you to the relevant sections.


== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `exp delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `exp delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the Main UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The Main UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` , `Calendar` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

.Structure of the Report UI Component
image::ReportUIClassDiagram.png[]

The Report UI consists of a `ReportWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `ReportCommandBox` and `Result Display` etc.
The `ReportWindow` and `ReportCommandBox`, inherit from abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. Layout of `ReportWindow` is defined in `.java` file that is in the `src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui` folder. For example the layout of `ReportWindow` is specified in link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-T10-3/main/tree/v1.3/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui[`ReportWindow.java`]
Layout of `ReportCommandBox` is defined in matching `.fxml` file that is in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-T10-3/main/blob/v1.3/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/ReportCommandBox.java[`ReportCommandBox`] is specified in link:{repoURL}https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-T10-3/main/blob/v1.3/src/main/resources/view/ReportCommandBox.fxml[`ReportCommandBox.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `TopLevelParser` class to parse the user command.
.  Depending on the command, the `TopLevelParser` class may use the `SubLevelParser` class e.g. `ExpLevelParser` +
to parse the command instead.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("exp delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `exp delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `ExpDeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the `$AVE IT` data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Expenditure>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the `$AVE IT` data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.saveit.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
//Reordered this section in alphabetical order
// tag::autocomplete[]
=== Autocomplete feature

==== Proposed Implementation

The autocomplete feature is facilitated by `AutoCompleteTextField.java`.
It extends the `TextField` component of JavaFx and provides a dropdown of possible commands.

To make use of the autocomplete feature. The backend will have to include the commands to be +
added which will be shown to the users. This allows easy configuration of what commands will +
be searched.

Given below is the example usage scenario of how the autocompletion works.

Step 1. Type into the command box. The function search and filter potential commands that the user might use. +
The commands will then be displayed in a dropdown format which the user can refer to when keying commands.

[NOTE]
For the current implementation, it checks whether the typed command matches the starting characters of any commands.
To be improved in later versions.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Usage of autocompletion

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Moving mouse over to select commands.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Does not meet target user needs who strongly prefers typing.
* **Alternative 2:** Use of tab to simulate autocompletion like a terminal.
** Pros: Intuitive for people used to using a terminal.
** Cons: Will have to direct the tab keystroke to be used for autocompletion.

===== Aspect: How autocompletion searches for completion items

===== Aspect: Data structure to support more powerful autocompletion

// end::autocomplete[]


=== Calendar feature [In progress]
Calendar is a feature that has a clickable calendar which users
can use to navigate between the different days. It also shows
the date of the expenditures the user is viewing as well as today.

==== Rationale



// end::calendar[]

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

// tag::repeat[]

=== Recurring Expenditure feature [In Progress]
Recurring expenditure is one of the main feature in `$AVE IT` and it is
a expenditure automatically logged for user at their preferred frequency.
==== Rationale
This feature allows user to keep track of expenditures that will occur either _daily_,
_monthly_ or _annually_ without the need to key in the expenditures every day or month.
Hence, this will provide more convenience for users as well as address the need
for such a feature since recurring expenditures are common. For example, day to day
commuting expenses.

// end::repeat[]

[[Implementation-Report]]
=== Report [In progress]
Report is one of the main feature in `$AVE IT`  and its purpose is to collate and
show users their expenditure breakdowns.

==== Rationale
The report feature is an important feature that allows users to see their
expenditure breakdowns within a certain time period. Currently, the expenditure
are categorise in terms of tags and this will give users a clear overview of
what they are spending on over this period of time.


==== Implementation
The report feature can be accessed from 2 platforms either *Main Window* or *Report Window*

* *Main Window*

The input from user is parsed using a specific command parser
depending on which of 3 commands: `report view`, `report print` and `report export` were inputted by user.

.Sequence Diagram for Report View
image::ReportViewSequence.png[]

.Sequence Diagram GenerateStats and Graph
image::GenerateStats_and_Graph.png[]

If a `report view` command was input, the _ViewReportCommandParser_  will parse the input and convert the Strings :
start date, end date and graph into _Date_ and _Report.GraphType_ object respectively. The _Date_ objects
and _Report.GraphType_ objects are used to create _ViewReportCommand_ object which will be
executed. The result of executions is popping out the _ReportWindow_ which will showcase a expenditure breakdown report.

If a `report print` command was input, the _PrintReportCommandParser_  will parse the input and convert the Strings :
start date, end date and graph into _Date_ and _Report.GraphType_ object respectively. The _Date_ objects
and _Report.GraphType_ objects are used to create _PrintReportCommand_ object which will be
executed. The result of execution will be sending a print job to your printer, printing out the report.

If a `report export` command was input, the _ExportReportCommandParser_  will parse the input and convert the Strings :
start date, end date and graph into _Date_ and _Report.GraphType_ object respectively. The _Date_ objects
and _Report.GraphType_ objects are used to create _ExportReportCommand_ object which will be
executed. The result of execution will be exporting a PDF version of the report into your computer.

==== Design Considerations

*Consideration : Minimal changes to current UI implementation, especially Main Window*

** Pros:  Less dependency with current working code for Main Window. Hence, even if report feature fails, it is
likely that Main Window can continue running.

** Cons: It could be more complicated to implement.

*Consideration : Avoid cluttering the Main Window UI*

** Pros: Better user experience.
** Pros: As report is not using any space in Main Window,
we could introduce and showcase other smaller and useful features in
the Main Winow UI.
** Cons: It could be more different to implement

Due to the above considerations ,we implemented report viewing in a pop up window.
