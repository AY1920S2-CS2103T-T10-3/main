== Introduction
$AVE IT is a desktop budget management application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
The application is aimed towards tertiary students who like to type a lot.
As tertiary students are at a stage without a fixed income, they can use this to manage their spending.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `$AVE IT.jar` coming soon.
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for $AVE IT application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:


* **`exp add`**`-i chicken rice -a $4.50` : adds new expenditure and information.
* **`exp delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd expenditure shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
