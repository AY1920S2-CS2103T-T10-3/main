== Introduction
$AVEIT is a desktop budget management application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
The application is aimed towards tertiary students who like to type a lot.
As tertiary students are at a stage without a fixed income, they can use this to manage their spending.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `$AVEIT.jar` coming soon.
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for $AVEIT application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:


* **`add`**`-i chicken rice -a $4.50` : adds new expenditure and information.
