== Introduction
$AVE IT is a *desktop budget management application*. We are here to assist
tertiary students who have needs in financial budgeting and management.
Tertiary students who have to manage finance accounts from different sources
such as school project and personal spending will find ease in using our application.


== Quick Start
.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `$AVE IT.jar`  https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-T10-3/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for $AVE IT application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing `help` and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `exp add -i chicken rice -a 4.50`: adds new expenditure and information.
* `exp delete 3`: deletes the 3rd expenditure shown in the current list.
* `exit` : exits the app.
.  You can refer to <<main-commands, Main Commands>> for details of each command.

== Features



=== Disjoint Accounts

=== Expenditures
_{ work in progress }_


//tag::repeat[]
=== Repeat
The _Repeat_ feature allows you to add recurring _expenditures_. +
You are able to create fixed expenditures records which will be recurring daily, weekly, monthly or annually.
As shown in the diagram below, a `repeat` will have a different display as compared to `expenditure`.
"Repeat details" includes the frequency of recurring, start date and end date are displayed.

.`Repeat` display
image::repeatDisplay.png[]

==== `Repeat` type commands
`Repeat` has very similar command as `Expenditure`, with just a few of values to be specified. +
Here, we will be using `repeat add` command as an example, while other `repeat` commands works the same way. +
Format: `repeat add -i INFO -a AMOUNT -sd START_DATE -ed END_DATE -p PERIOD [-t TAG]` +

*1* Key in the command into the command box. We will be using `repeat add -i bubble tea -a 3.50 -sd 2020-04-01 -ed 2020-04-30 -p weekly -t drink`
as an example.

.Input command
image::repeatInput.png[]

*2* A response will be given to indicate that this recurring expenditure has been recorded.

.Response given
image::repeatResponse.png[]

*3* As the `START_DATE` is 2020-04-01 and the `PERIOD` is set to weekly,
thus the first record will be at 2020-04-01 and last record will be on 2020-04-29.

.Added to 2020-04-01
image::firstRepeatRecord.png[]

.Added to 2020-04-29
image::lastRepeatRecord.png[]

==== NOTE
For `repeat add -i rental fee -a 300 -sd 2020-03-31 -ed 2021-03-31 -p monthly -t housing`,
as the start date is `2020-03-31`, the next tentative date should be `2020-04-31` but this date is invalid.
Hence, this expenditure record will be shown on `2020-04-30` instead. For May, it will be still shown on `2020-05-31`. +
*This applies to leap year too*

=== Report

==== Function
The _Report_ feature allows you to have a quick overview of your expenditures.
It can tell you your total spending within a period of time and have your spending
categorised either by month or tag. You can have also have a permanent copy
of the report, through the report printing and export capabilities.

.Bar chart report
image::report_bar_ss.png[]



This is an example of the report in bar chart format with the expenditures grouped by months.
The horizontal line represents the expenditures whereas the vertical line shows
the month followed by the total spending in that month.
Alternatively, you can also group the expenditure by tags and read off the bar chart
in a similar fashion.

If you are a visual person, you can consider using the pie chart format instead!

.Pie chart report
image::report_pie.png[]


This is an example of report in pie chart format with the expenditures grouped by
tags.

If you are interested to find out more, you can explore <<Report command, Report Command>>
to find out how to generate these graphs.


//tag::calendar[]
=== Calendar
The _calendar_ feature aims to ease users' navigation experience. +
  *1*. Users is able to traverse between different dates by clicking on the calendar. +
  *2*. Users is able to make use of `go` command to navigate to other date.

With reference to the diagram below, *Header* displays the year and month which the
calendar is displaying. *Box 1* displays the day which you are looking at
while *Box 2* refers to the today's date.

.Calendar View
image::calendarExplanation.png[]

==== Navigate using calendar
It is troublesome and inconvenient for users to keep on make use of command line input
to navigate between the dates, especially when the date which user wants to view is just one or
two days before. +
Under this situation, user can interact with `calendar` and navigate with a simple click.

For example, we are now viewing expenditure records which are on `2020-04-09`.
And we wish to view previous day's expenditure record. We can simply click on the date on the calendar.
Below are two diagrams which will show the operation.

.Before click (9 April)
image::beforeClick.png[]

.After click (8 April)
image::afterClick.png[]

==== Navigate with `go` command
The developer team has taken into account the case when users wish to navigate to another date
which is way before or after. Thus, we have integrate the `calendar` with `go` command. +

For example, we are now viewing expenditure records which are on `2020-04-09` and we wish to navigate to
`2019-04-09` through `go` command. +
*1*. We need to input `go 2019-04-09` into the command box which is shown in the diagram below.

.`go` command example
image::goCommandInput.png[]

*2*. A response will be given to indicate that the date has changed.

.`go` command response
image::goCommandResponse.png[]

*3*. The `calendar` and the expenditure records will update accordingly.

.`calendar` and expenditure records are updated accordingly.

=== Saving the data

$AVE IT data is stored in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.


[[main-commands]]
== Main Commands

====
*Command Format*:

Let's use a command format, +
`exp add -i INFO -a AMOUNT [-t TAG] [-d DATE]` +
as an example.

* The first word is the *operation category* of the command, in this case, `exp`
belongs to the expenditure operations.
* There may be a second word which is the specific command for the operation
category, in this case, `add`.
* Words starting with `-` e.g. `-i`, `-a` and `-t` are the *option prefix*. Not all
commands have options, an example is deleting an expenditure, `exp delete 1`.
* Words in caps are the *parameters* to be supplied by the user. `INFO`, `AMOUNT`
and `TAG` are parameters representing information, amount and tag of the
expenditure respectively. It can be used as such,
`exp add -i chicken rice -a 4.50 -t food`.
* Items in square brackets are optional, that means in this example
`exp add -i chicken rice -a 4.50` is also valid.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies
`-i INFO -a AMOUNT`, `-a AMOUNT -i INFO` is also acceptable.
* However, if the parameter is not prefixed by any option prefixes, the order of
the parameter matters.
