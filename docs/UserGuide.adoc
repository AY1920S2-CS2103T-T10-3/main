== Introduction
$AVE IT is a desktop budget management application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
The application is aimed towards tertiary students who like to type a lot.
As tertiary students are at a stage without a fixed income, they can use this to manage their spending.

.  Download the latest `$AVEIT.jar` coming soon.
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for $AVE IT application.
