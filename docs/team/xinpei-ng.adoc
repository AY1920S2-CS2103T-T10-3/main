== PROJECT: $AVE IT

---

== Overview

$AVE IT is a desktop budget management application.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *Report Feature*
** What it does:
*** It allows the user to *generate a report* based on their expenditures (including repeat). User can specify the date range and type of
the report (bar chart or pie chart) and how they want their spending to be categorised (month or tag).
*** Added functionality to *print* and *export* the report.
*** Report is shown in a *pop out window* which also allow users to type in `Report commands` only.

** Justification:
*** This feature improves the product significantly because it gives user a overview of what they are spending on,
which can equip them with better knowledge of their spending habits.
*** Some users might want to have a permanent copy of their report,
hence the *print* and *export* report function was introduced
which give users the choice of having both hard and soft copy of their report.
*** The pop out window was added avoid cluttering the Main Window.

** Highlights:
*** This feature works together with `expenditure` and `repeat` feature. As the `repeat` feature
allowed expenditures to occur at varying frequency : daily, weekly, monthly or annually,
calculation of spending became complex especially since users are able to have specified start and end date
eg: 2020-03-12 to 2020-04-28.
*** When user types `report view` command, a Report Window will pop out showcasing the report
user has requested. This made implementation challenging as I had to set up the UI.
*** User is able to *print* or *export* the report so long it is showcased in
the report window.

** Credits: JavaFXSwingUtils is used for exporting and printing.

* *Major enhancement* : added *Report Window*
** What it does:
*** Show cases the report user requested for.
*** It is able to take in `Report command` , execute and show case the result of the command.

** Justification:
*** Avoid cluttering the Main Window UI with report showing there.
*** It is likely that users only needed report at specified occasions and not all the time, hence I
implemented a pop out window which user can close when they no longer need the report.

** Highlights:
*** This feature works with `Report` feature.
*** Users can also access the Report Window via `report button` in Main Window, which made
implementation slightly challenging as I had to take care of cases where there is no
report generated.
