== PROJECT: $AVE IT

---

== Overview

$AVE IT is a desktop budget management application.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *Report Feature*
** What it does:
*** It allows the user to *generate a report* based on their spending. User can specify the date range and type of
graph for their report and how they want their spending to be categorised.
*** Added functionality to *print* and *export* the report.
*** Report is shown in a *pop out window* which also allow users to type in `Report commands` only.

** Justification:
*** This feature improves the product significantly because it gives user a overview of what they are spending on,
which can equip them with better knowledge of their spending habits.
*** Some users might want to have a permanent copy of their report,
hence the *print* and *export* report function was introduced
which give users the choice of having both hard and soft copy of their report.
*** The pop out window was added to avoid cluttering the Main Window.

** Highlights:
*** This feature works together with `expenditure` and `repeat` feature.  `repeat` feature
allowed expenditures to occur at varying frequency : daily, weekly, monthly or annually. This caused the
calculation of spending to become complex especially since users are able to specify start and end date
eg: 2020-03-12 to 2020-04-28 for report.
*** Users can *print* or *export* report from either the Main Window or
Report Window. This make implementation tedious as I had to ensure that the command input into
Report Window does not reflect on Main Window.
*** Users can *print* or *export* report in Report Window at any time, so
long the report is not changed by a `view` command.

** Credits:
*** JavaFXSwingUtils is used for exporting and printing.
*** AB3 code for primary setup of Report Window.

* *Major enhancement* : added *Report Window*
** What it does:
*** Show cases the report user requested for.
*** It is able to take in `Report commands` , execute and show case the result of the command.

** Justification:
*** Avoid cluttering the Main Window UI with report showing there.
*** It is likely that users only needs report at specified occasions and not all the time, hence I
implemented a pop out window which user can close when they no longer need the report.

** Highlights:
*** This feature works with `Report` feature.
*** Users can also access the Report Window via `report button` in Main Window, which made
implementation slightly challenging as I had to take care of cases where there is no
report generated.
