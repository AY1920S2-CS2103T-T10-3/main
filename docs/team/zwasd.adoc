== PROJECT: $AVE IT

---

== Overview

$AVE IT is a desktop budget management application. The user interacts with it
using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and
has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *autocomplete feature*
** What it does: The Autocomplete feature allows you to complete the commands of
the application when you type.
** Justification: As most of the functionality is command based, autocompletion
makes it more efficient for when using our application. Also, users do not have
to recall the variety of commands the application has from memory.
** Highlights:
*** As there are many ways to implement autocompletion, quite some research is
done to determine the best way to implement and design it, with multiple data structures and algorithms to choose from.
*** The implementation was challenging as it requires digging into JavaFx listeners.

* *Major enhancement*: added *budget feature*
** What it does: The budget feature allows the user to set monthly budgets and
show how much money they can spend given their expenditures.
** Justification: Setting a budget is crucial, as one only has a limited amount
of money to spend. So having a budget can help user stay on tack to save more.
** Highlights:
*** The implementation of the budget is stored monthly, which differs from the
main part of the application that are stored daily. This makes the logic and
storage different from the base components.
*** Calculation of spendings are done using expenditures and repeats which
functions differently, hence requiring a bit more work too.
